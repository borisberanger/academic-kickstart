# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Extreme values of real phenomena are events that occur with low frequency, but can have a large impact on real life. These are, in many practical problems, high-dimensional by nature (e.g. Tawn, 1990; Coles and Tawn, 1991). To study these events is of fundamental importance. For this purpose, probabilistic models and statistical methods are in high demand. There are several approaches to modelling multivariate extremes as described in Falk et al. (2011), linked to some extent. We describe an approach for deriving multivariate extreme value models and we illustrate the main features of some flexible extremal dependence models. We compare them by showing their utility with a real data application, in particular analyzing the extremal dependence among several pollutants recorded in the city of Leeds, UK."
