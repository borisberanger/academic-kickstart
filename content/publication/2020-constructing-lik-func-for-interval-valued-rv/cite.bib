  abstract = {Abstract There is a growing need for flexible methods to analyze interval-valued data, which can provide efficient data representations for very large data sets. However, the existing descriptive frameworks to achieve this ignore the process by which interval-valued data are typically constructed, namely, by the aggregation of real-valued data generated from some underlying process. In this paper, we develop the foundations of likelihood-based statistical inference for intervals that directly incorporates the underlying data generating procedure into the analysis. That is, it permits the direct fitting of models for the underlying real-valued data given only the interval-valued summaries. This generative approach overcomes several problems associated with existing methods, including the rarely satisfied assumption of within-interval uniformity. The new methods are illustrated by simulated and real data analyses.},
